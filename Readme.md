### Trees

#### Binary Search Tree
A binary search tree is a form of tree in which each node contains at most two other nodes, labelled right and left. 

Binary Search Trees are ordered, meaning that all child nodes will be less than the root node on the left and greater than the root node on the right, as pictured here:
