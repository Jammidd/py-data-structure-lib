# Data Structure Library
This library contains various usefull data structures. The library will be added upon from time to time and is intended to be used as a template or guideline for those learning how to implement popular data structures in Python.


### Trees
---

#### Binary Tree
The binary tree is a form of tree in which each node contains at most two other nodes, typically labeled right and left.

Binary Trees are unordered, meaning that child nodes on either side could be greater than or less than the root node. As pictured below:

#### Binary Search Tree
A binary search tree is similar to a binary tree in that each node contains at most two other nodes.

A Binary Search Tree, unlike a Binary Tree, is ordered, meaning that all child nodes will be less than the root node on the left and greater than the root node on the right, as pictured here:
